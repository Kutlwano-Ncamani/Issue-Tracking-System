A bug tracker is a piece of software that is essential to the quality control and software development processes. Its main job is to keep tabs on and handle software issues, also known as software defects. 
Bug trackers give development teams a centralized method for logging, classifying, and ranking reported issues. This promotes efficient communication and teamwork.
A bug tracker's essential features include:

1.	Issue reporting: Users have the option to submit thorough bug reports that include descriptions, how-to instructions, and any pertinent attachments.
2.	Issue tracking: Each reported issue is given a special identification by the bug tracker, allowing for simple monitoring and reference throughout the development lifecycle.
3.	Workflow management enables teams to build and personalize processes that guarantee reported defects move through multiple phases, including triage, assignment, repairing, testing, and resolution.
4.	Bug trackers allow teams to prioritize issues and allocate them to certain team members, assuring prompt resolution.
5.	Communication and cooperation: Users can debate, comment, and add to topics, promoting productive cooperation and knowledge exchange.
6.	Metrics and reporting: Bug trackers produce metrics and reports to monitor bug trends, gauge team effectiveness, and pinpoint areas in need of development.
Overall, bug trackers improve the effectiveness and caliber of the software development lifecycle by streamlining the bug management procedure.
